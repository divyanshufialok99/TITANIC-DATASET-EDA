# TITANIC-DATASET-EDA
# Titanic Dataset Analysis Project README

This repository contains the code and results of an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project conducted on the Titanic dataset. In this project, we delve into the dataset, test hypotheses, generate visualizations, and present insights regarding factors influencing survival rates aboard the Titanic.

## Project Organization

This project is structured with the following key folders:

- Src: Housing Jupyter Notebook files containing the analytical code.
- Data: Storing the Titanic dataset (in CSV format).
- Docs: Reserved for supplementary documentation or related materials.
- Results: Dedicated to storing generated plots and the final PDF report.

## Dataset

The Titanic dataset is available in CSV format. It comprises the following columns:

- `PassengerId`: A unique identifier assigned to each passenger.
- `Survived`: A binary indicator, where 0 signifies that the passenger did not survive, and 1 indicates that they survived.
- `Pclass`: The passenger's class (1st, 2nd, or 3rd).
- `Name`: The passenger's name.
- `Sex`: The gender of the passenger.
- `Age`: The passenger's age.
- `SibSp`: The count of siblings or spouses accompanying the passenger.
- `Parch`: The count of parents or children accompanying the passenger.
- `Ticket`: The passenger's ticket number.
- `Fare`: The fare paid by the passenger.
- `Cabin`: The cabin number.
- `Embarked`: The port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).

## Analysis

Within this repository, you will find Jupyter notebooks that guide you through a detailed analysis of the Titanic dataset. The analysis encompasses the following key sections:

The project encompasses the following steps:

1. **Data Acquisition**: The Titanic dataset was sourced from Kaggle.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: EDA was carried out on the dataset to gain a comprehensive understanding of its structure. This phase included handling missing values, data preprocessing, and presenting summary statistics and visualizations.

3. **Hypotheses Testing**: Hypotheses Testing: Three hypotheses were formulated and tested to unravel the variables influencing survival on the Titanic. These hypotheses are:

Hypothesis 1: Investigating the correlation between survival rates and passenger class.
Hypothesis 2: Examining the relationship between survival rates and gender.
Hypothesis 3: Analyzing survival rates with respect to age.

4. **Visualization**: To support the hypotheses, we generated relevant plots that illustrate patterns and relationships within the data.

5. **Summary Report**: The Jupyter Notebook contains a comprehensive report, offering insights, interpretations, and statistical outcomes. It also sheds light on emerging trends and patterns observed in the dataset.

6. **PDF Report** The Jupyter Notebook was transformed into a PDF report, facilitating sharing and presentation.
